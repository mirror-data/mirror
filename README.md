### A Natural Language Interface for Data Querying, Summarization, and Visualization

Mirror is a project that aims to build and share a natural language interface for data querying, summarization, and visualization. This repository contains the code for the user interface (UI) as well as the code for creating SQL queries, summaries, and visualizations.

## Overview

Data exploration and analysis are critical tasks for organizations, but can be challenging due to technical expertise requirements and complex tools. Mirror is an open-source platform for data exploration and analysis powered by large language and code models, GPT-3 and Codex. It offers an intuitive natural language interface for querying databases, automatically generates SQL commands, and provides visualizations for data understanding. Mirror is designed to be flexible and suitable for both experienced data analysts and non-technical professionals. It is a "plug-and-play" tool that leverages pretrained models, eliminating the need for annotated data. The platform is demonstrated through two use cases: automatic question answering for sports with real-time updates, and OSS Insight Data Explorer for open-source event analysis. Future work includes exploring dialogue-based multi-round query to improve self-correction ability and user interaction through a dialogue-like interface, by combining ChatGPT and the SQL engine.

## Development

### Dependencies

Mirror uses the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 

- React
- Matine.dev
- Vega

To set up a development environment, you will need the following:

- Node.js version 16 or higher
- Yarn as the package manager

### Running the Code

Follow these steps to run the code locally:

1. Set environment variables

   ```
   # .env.local
   
   # Your OpenAI API key
   OPENAI_API_KEY={{REPLACE_IT_WITH_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}}
   
   # Your Postgres URL, e.g. postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
   PG_URL="{{REPLACE_IT_WITH_YOUR_POSTGRES_URL}}"
   
   # Enable basic auth
   # BASIC_AUTH={username}:{password}
   ```

2. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`

3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server



### Deployment

To deploy Mirror, follow these steps:

1. Build the web static server

   ```
   yarn build & yarn export
   ```

2. Build a Docker image

   ```
   # Build Docker image
   docker build -t mirror-data/mirror .
   
   # Multi-arch build
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t mirror-data/mirror .
   ```
